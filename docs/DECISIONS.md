# Decision record

Binding. Later entries override earlier ones. Every entry is dated, states what
was decided, and states the reason — a decision without a reason cannot be
revisited intelligently.

## 2026-09-08 §1 — Rebuild rather than refactor

The predecessor tree (29k lines of server code, 35k of tests) is sound in its
invariants and wrong in three structural choices: a precompiled LangGraph per
route, a SQLite/Postgres split, and route resolution built from the catalog's
untyped display list. The first two are removable; the third invalidates every
route the system has ever run. Rebuilding is cheaper than unpicking, and the
invariants transfer intact.

## 2026-09-08 §2 — Runtime DAG follows legacy

The route is resolved from `profile["edges"]` with typed edges
(`REQUIRED`/`CONDITIONAL`/`QA_GATE` blocking, `OPTIONAL`/`ADVISORY` soft until
the source is READY), node states `COMPLETE`/`BLOCKED`/`RESTRICTED`/`RUNNABLE`,
and a frontier of runnable plus restricted. Invariant 10 is not weakened but
re-pinned: the *resolved* route is digested at the gate and execution reads only
the pin.

**Reason.** The predecessor read `navigation.dependencies` — 97 untyped pairs
meant for display — so 25 OPTIONAL and 22 ADVISORY edges were enforced as
mandatory, the single QA_GATE did not gate, and RESTRICTED could not occur.

## 2026-09-08 §3 — No checkpointer

Execution state is the accepted-attempt ledger. Recovery is recomputation of
`node_states`, not restoration of a checkpoint.

**Reason.** A legacy-style route cannot be precompiled, so a graph framework's
checkpoint buys nothing the run store does not already own — and the split
between checkpoint and domain state was the source of most of the
predecessor's recovery machinery.

## 2026-09-08 §4 — PostgreSQL only

One database from the first commit, including run state. No SQLite tier.

**Reason.** Five entries on the predecessor's known-gaps ledger existed only
because of that split.

## 2026-09-08 §5 — CP-PARSE stays a separate host node

The upstream bundle merges CP-PARSE into CP-0. The host keeps them as separate
stage-0 nodes via an `_ALIASES` carve-out, overriding both the new
`superseded_module_ids["CP-PARSE"]` entry and `preparation_stage.runnable:
false`.

**Reason.** CP-PARSE owns the `document_parse_manifest` over the host's own
already-extracted immutable blocks. That object is host territory. Revisit if a
future bundle collapses the two schemas.

**Consequence.** `assemble_authority` must not slice `SKILL.md` on section
markers — the merged skill has dropped `## CP-PARSE runnable profile`, which
would break CP-0 as well as CP-PARSE. CP-PARSE receives the whole CP-0 skill
plus its own reference files.

## 2026-09-08 §6 — Never edit an upstream bundle file

New behaviour goes in new skill folders. New route nodes ride a host-declared
extension mirroring `research_extension`, never a catalog edit.

**Reason.** One Deploy V release changed 175 files including 21 of 22
`SKILL.md`. Every upstream file we touch becomes a permanent merge and moves the
whole-tree pin.

## 2026-09-08 §7 — LibreOffice is required, not optional

`soffice` is the workbook's formula verification engine and is installed in the
worker image. The build fails closed without it.

**Reason.** Reverses an earlier recommendation made before reading
`cp_model_v3/builder.py`. Legacy recalculates through soffice and then validates
the sheet registry, the formula inventory and every computed value against an
independently computed expectation. The predecessor shipped LibreOffice and
never invoked it, so its workbooks were never evaluated at all — a formula
resolving to `#DIV/0!` shipped silently.

## 2026-09-08 §8 — `cash_flow_forecast` and CP-CF

A deterministic forecast calculator, and the module that declares it, both in a
new skill folder.

**Reason.** CP-2G states its roll-forward rules in prose and emits 42 driver
rows; no host code computed the projection, so leverage and coverage were
recomputed deterministically over arithmetic a model performed.

## 2026-09-08 §9 — Coordinate-anchored citations (invariant 11)

A citation is `{document_sha256, page, bbox, matched_text}`, re-located by the
host in its token index.

**Reason.** The predecessor's locators were line ranges over extracted text.
"One click from its evidence" meant one click to a line range, not to a region
on a page.
